A widespread method for this is principal component analysis ([PCA](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html)). It finds a linear transformation of the data into principal component space, thereby decorrelating the data. Because each principle component (PC) explains as much variance in the data as possible (while being orthogonal to all previous principal components), we can use the explained variance as a measure of the  \"importance\" of each PC. This will help us decide, how many dimensions (= PCs) we need to keep."

McsPyDataTools Tutorials
========================

These tutorials can be found as Jupyter Notebooks in the **McsPyDataNotebooks** folder of the Github repository. They rely on data files that are distributed either in the **McsPy/tests/TestData** folder or (in case of larger test files) as part of a separate repository that can be downloaded from https://download.multichannelsystems.com/download_data/software/multi-channel-datamanager/McsPyDataTools-TestDataFiles.zip
